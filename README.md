////////////////// Sieve of Eratosthenes //////////////////

In 250s BCE the sieve of Eratosthenes was discovered to find prime numbers.  I implemented two versions of this sieve algorithm.  The first uses two procedures/method/subroutines to find all the prime numbers in a range starting from 2 – given number.  In this example I use 2 – 2017.

The two method approach reflects how a humyn thinks and would approach solving the problem.  The single method approach is a more streamlined approach. 

Example: 
	Execute
		java SieveofEratosthenes2

	Compile
		javac SieveofEratosthenes2.java

	Output of 2 – 10,000
